### Install
This application doesn't need any server. Just open index.html on each folder on your browser to run the app. 

If you have any trouble opening the file directly, you can use any kind of server that allows to use static files. If you don't have any server, you can use [Mongoose](https://cesanta.com/binary.html). It's a standalone web server, you can download and execute on the folder you want to run, no configuration needed.

### Pixabay key
In order to execute the search on Pixabay you need to have a user on that platform, and [go to the API document page](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) and go to the first API example. There is your API key for your user. Copy the file `/js/pixabay-config-sample.js` to `pixabay-config.js` and set you API key there.
